# Privacy Policy for WordMark

WordMark does not collect, transmit, or sell personal data.

All word lookup history, preferences, and API keys are stored locally in the user's browser.

When translation is enabled, the selected word or definition text is sent directly to the chosen third-party translation API (e.g., Gemini) only to retrieve translation results.

No browsing history, full webpage content, or personal information is collected or stored by the developer.
